    """
    This class implements the Forest-fire model as outlined in Drossel and Schwabl's 1992 paper  "Self-organized
    critical forest-fire model".
    The rules of the cellular automata are as follows:
        1) A burning cell turns into an empty cell
        2) A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
        3) A tree ignites with probability f, even if no neighbor is burning (lightning strike)
        4) An empty space fills with a tree with probability p
